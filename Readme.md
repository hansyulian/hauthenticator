# Backstory
Today is the June of 2023. Recently `Google Authenticator` has just been updated their icon from `G` into `six sticks`. Together with the icon update, they also updated the app with some abomination of feature: `cloud sync` that thanks for it, it duplicate the authenticator that I have in my android phone, iphone, and any other source from 30-ish to become 100+ of duplication. They also lack the feature to:
- search
- filter
- clean duplicate
- fingerprint authentication
- proper cloud sync
So I create this project to make my `dream authenticator` with the goal in mind while also learning `expo`. Right now I mainly a `react-native` developer and have already know expo for like 5 years, but haven't get any chance to use it yet. So for this personal project, I decided to use `expo` and build what I want while learning new things.
